# How to run this code?

## Prerequisities

- Docker engine
- Node.js version 16

### 1. Clone neutron, gaia and neutron-query-relayer

Clone neutron and relayer to the parent directory:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:neutron-org/neutron.git
git clone git@github.com:neutron-org/neutron-query-relayer.git
```

We use the Gaia network as a host network, so you need to clone it next to the neutron repos. We use v9.0.3 for the tests.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:cosmos/gaia.git
git checkout v9.0.3
```

### 2. Prepare docker environment

For the first run it's required to run `make build-all` in the `setup/` directory to build all the docker images before you run the tests with `yarn test`

### 3. Install dependencies with command

```shell
yarn
```

### 4. Download or build contracts

#### Downloading

The pre-build contracts for specific commits are stored in the publicly available Google Cloud Bucket.
One can download them via following commands:

```shell
node download_artifacts.js neutron-dao neutron-dev-contracts
node download_artifacts.js neutron-tge-contracts -b main
```

If you want to specify any specific branch/commit, use the following command to get more info on how to do that:

```shell
node download_artifacts.js --help
```

#### Building

If the contracts version you need is unavailable, or you need a custom one, you can easily use the contracts built by yourself.
To do so, build the contracts from [neutron-dev-contracts](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron-dev-contracts) and [neutron-dao](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron-dao) by following respective instructions.
After artifacts build, put all built `.wasm` files to `contracts/` directory.

### 5. Run the tests (make sure docker daemon is running)

```shell
yarn test # all tests
yarn test:simple # basic tests
yarn test:interchaintx # interchain txs test
yarn test:interchain_tx_query # interchain tx query test
yarn test:interchain_kv_query # interchain kv query test
```

NOTE: To speed up tests you can run the cosmopark by youself with `make start-cosmopark` in the setup dir. To run test with the already running cosmopark use `NO_DOCKER` env variable.

```shell
NO_DOCKER=1 yarn test # all tests
...
```

## Warning

Since docker-compose doesn't rebuild images on file changing, there is a chance for one to launch the tests with an
outdated version of code if one changed something. To rebuild the images from scratch, do the following:

```
cd ../neutron
docker rmi neutron-node
docker rmi neutron-org/neutron-query-relayer
docker-compose build
```

## Environment variables you can redefine

```env
NEUTRON_DENOM - neutron network denom
COSMOS_DENOM - gaia (cosmoshub) network denom
CONTRACTS_PATH - path to contracts that will be used in tests
NEUTRON_ADDRESS_PREFIX - address prefix for neutron controller network
COSMOS_ADDRESS_PREFIX - address prefix for gaia (cosmoshub) host network
NODE1_URL - url to the first node
NODE1_WS_URL - url to websocket of the first node
NODE2_URL - url to the second node
NODE2_WS_URL - url to websocket of the second node
BLOCKS_COUNT_BEFORE_START - how many blocks we wait before start first test
NO_DOCKER - do not start cosmopark for tests
NO_REBUILD - skip containers rebuilding
```
